I'm self-learning this class through YouTube to
* Take a step further and explore more about deep learning.
* Get a head start on concepts to my DL classes next quarter, so I will be more prepared.

I'll gain a more thorough understanding by learning from supplementary materials from CS 182 (Deep Neural Networks) at UC Berkeley and [6.S191 (Introduction to Deep Learning)](http://introtodeeplearning.com/) at MIT

To get a solid understanding of course material, I am also doing the following activities during the winter break:
* Making progress in Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera.
